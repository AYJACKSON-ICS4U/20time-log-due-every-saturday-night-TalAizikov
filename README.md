# __20Time-Project__

***

## Week 1 Log
This week I have submited my **20time projct** to google class room. I plan to make a 2D game that will have a running character that will  try to avoid lazer that will be shot at him. The game will also have a upgrade shop where you can buy greater speed, more health etc.. I have not started researching of how I am going to make the game but I am planning to do that this weekend.

## Week 2 Log
I kept trying to make the game happen but it was not working out for me. I chose to switch to try to solve a rubics cube. I have *always* wanted to solve a rubics cube every since I was little, for many reasons like:
- It's cool
- If you know how to solve it you look smart
- It's fun

## Week 3 Log
I learn how to solve a rubics cube - **in about 80 minutes** -. The Youtube video I watched was only 15 minutes but it took me 80 minutes to solve it. I am learning the most basic method right now and I am planning to improve my time a lot. My goal is 30 seconds

## Week 4 Log
My times have improved so much! I got from 80 minutes to 3 minutes! Now I remember all the algorithms it that helps me solve the cube way faster. I want to learn more advanced methods this week. So far my times have been as followed (about accurate):
1. 80:00
2. 45:00
3. 20:00
4. 12:00
5. 10:00
6. 8:00
7. 9:00
8. 6:00
9. 4:00
10. 3:00
11. 2:30

## Week 5 Log
My times stopped getting lower so I learn 2 advanced methods. I learned how to solve the cross on the white side (instead of the yellow), and I learned f2l. First my times were horrible. My times went up from 2:30 to about 3:30 - 4:00. I was thinking to go back to beginners method but I kept trying and my times kept getting better. My best time so far is **1:04!!** .
