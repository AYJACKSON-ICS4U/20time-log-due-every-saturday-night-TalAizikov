# __20Time-Project__

***

## Week 1 Log
This week I have submited my **20time projct** to google class room. I plan to make a 2D game that will have a running character that will  try to avoid lazer that will be shot at him. The game will also have a upgrade shop where you can buy greater speed, more health etc.. I have not started researching of how I am going to make the game but I am planning to do that this weekend.

## Week 2 Log
I kept trying to make the game happen but it was not working out for me. I chose to switch to try to solve a rubics cube. I have *always* wanted to solve a rubics cube every since I was little, for many reasons like:
- It's cool
- If you know how to solve it you look smart
- It's fun

## Week 3 Log
I learn how to solve a rubics cube - **in about 80 minutes** -. The Youtube video I watched was only 15 minutes but it took me 80 minutes to solve it. I am learning the most basic method right now and I am planning to improve my time a lot. My goal is 30 seconds

## Week 4 Log
My times have improved so much! I got from 80 minutes to 3 minutes! Now I remember all the algorithms it that helps me solve the cube way faster. I want to learn more advanced methods this week. So far my times have been as followed (about accurate):
1. 80:00
2. 45:00
3. 20:00
4. 12:00
5. 10:00
6. 8:00
7. 9:00
8. 6:00
9. 4:00
10. 3:00
11. 2:30


## Week 5 Log
My times stopped getting lower so I learn 2 advanced methods. I learned how to solve the cross on the white side (instead of the yellow), and I learned f2l. First my times were horrible. My times went up from 2:30 to about 3:30 - 4:00. I was thinking to go back to beginners method but I kept trying and my times kept getting better. My best time so far is **1:04!!** .

## Week 6 Log
The progress is going super well. My times keep getting lower, but I am scared I might stop getting lower. Right now my best time is **00:54** which is pretty good. I keep getting closer and closer to my goal but my progress is getting slower. 

## Week 7 Log
I chose to learn some more algorisms but there is _so many_ algorisms to remember so I am having a hard time. I avrage around 55 seconds right now and my best time is **00:36**. I want to beat my 30 second goal and then maybe switch my 20 time to something else. I want to give the game another try but this time have no graphics at all.

## Week 8 Log
**I am gonna focus on getting faster and not remembering algorisms!!** my best time is now **00:32** I am getting really close to my goal. I hope to reach my goal by the end of next week!

## Week 9 Log
**I reached my goal with a time of 28.89!** I got my goal of under 30 seconds. I avrage about 45 seconds more or less. I think I will switched my 20 time to a game now. I will come up with an idea for next week and hopfully I will be able to execute it.

## Week 10 Log
I know I can improve more, but I dont know if I want to. The faster your time comes the harder it is to get better. I started with 80 minutes and the second try I got 45 minutes. Now I need about 100 tries to improve my time by about 1 second. I will try to be able to average 30 second but I am not sure if it will work.

## Week 11 Log
I got this **amazing** idea to unsolve a rubics cube. I want to be able to match someones scramble. I know it is really really hard but if I will be able to do it with an avarage of about 1 minute it will be great. First will just try to do it. If i wont be able to I will try to find some toturial online and if that does not work I will take a day or two to think about how it can be done.

## Week 12 Log
First I tried to just match it but I couldn't. Then I tried to find toturials online but did not have luck. It took me a day to think of a way that might work. What I am doing now it solving it like I do a regular cube but think of the colours as groups. One group could be 3 yellows, 2 reds, 3 greens, 2 blues and I know that for the other cube I need to have the first layer as 3 yellows, 2 reds, 3 greens, 2 blues. I was not able to solve it yet but I think it can be done.

## Week 13 Log
I was able to do it. **Way harder** then I thought it will be.
